- Add a new book (`POST /books`)
- Update a book by ID (`PUT /books/:id`)
- Delete a book by ID (`DELETE /books/:id`)

## Tech Stack

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing

# what i learnt

In this project, I learned how to create a simple REST API using Node.js and Express. I understood how to set up a basic server and create different routes to perform CRUD operations—like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting books. Instead of using a database, I used an array to store the books in memory, which helped me learn how to manage data in JavaScript. I also learned how to handle HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Using Postman, I tested each route and saw how the API responds. Overall, this project helped me understand the fundamentals of backend development and how RESTful APIs work.
